                    Hi, I'm Roger. I graduated from UC Davis in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Animal 
                    Biology. I'm currently located in Northern California, but I spent the majority of my life
                    down in Los Angeles.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm a nerdy kid who enjoys comics, spending a lot of time on Netflix and browsing Reddit.
                    I spend too much time bothering and taking pictures of my two cats. I've worked with 
                    different species of animals during all sorts of jobs, and had always thought I would keep 
                    working with them, until I discovered coding.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    I really love building stuff from scratch and am looking forward to 
                    seeing all the different ways I can do that. Please check out my <a href="portfolio.html">
                    portfolio</a> if you have some time. I will be updating it with my boot camp 
                    projects, and any side projects I have been working on. Please <a href="contact.html">
                    contact</a> me if there are any projects I can help you with.
                </p>
